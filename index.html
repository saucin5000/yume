  <title>Akinosuke no Yume | YUME</title>
		<meta property="title" content="https://www.yume-eth.com">
			<meta property="description" content="The dream was so vivid that Akinosuke found himself marrying the King’s daughter and ruling an island province for many years. However, his happiness was short-lived when his wife passed away, and Akinosuke was sent back to his world. As he recounted his dream to his friends, they discovered a cryptic message about Ryoshi’s vision. A yellow butterfly, which could have been Akinosuke’s soul, emerged from his mouth and was taken by an ant under the cedar tree. The group delved deeper into the mystery and discovered a great kingdom of ants, which Akinosuke realized was the kingdom he visited in his dream. As they continued their search, they found a small female ant buried in a clay coffin beneath a small stone that resembled a burial monument.">

      <p class="mb-1 main">Ryoshi hesitated for a moment before reaching out, wondering if his friend would even remember him after all these years. But when they finally met up, it was like no time had passed at all. They spent hours catching up, reminiscing about old times and laughing over shared memories.
        <br/>
<br/>

And then Ryoshi brought up their unfinished trek. His friend’s eyes lit up at the suggestion, and before long they were making plans to finish what they had started all those years ago. They spent the next few weeks training and preparing, mapping out their route and gathering supplies.
<br/><br/>

Finally, over the next few weeks, Ryoshi made his appearence evident within his old friends daily essence. Through little events, that would spawn spiratically, his legatimacy would be told.</p></blockquote>
